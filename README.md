# Generate-TV-Scripts

The project is aimed at generating my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs.  This project was a part of the Udacity Nanodegree program. 

# Description

A Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons will be used to train the model. The Neural Network built will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

# Results

The goal of the project was to meet the following specifications:
* The function create_lookup_tables is implemented
* Batching Data
* Build the RNN
* RNN Training - Reasonable hyperparameters are selected for training, The model shows improvement during training
* The generator code generates a script
